            <h3>Hannah West</h3><br>
            <p>Currently, I do full-stack web development at a major healthcare tech company in KCMO and attend the University of Kansas full-time.
            I am passionate about many aspects of development and love the continuous learning it offers. 
            I am also interested in online/cyber security and serve as the Vice President of the KU Information Security Club known as the Jayhackers. 
            I have many passions that span beyond the tech realm as well. For example, I love to mountain bike, hangout with my corgi, and play guitar.</p>
