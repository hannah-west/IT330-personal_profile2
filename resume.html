            <h4>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology - Anticipated December 2019</h4>
                <p>
                    Within the BSIT program at KU I am gaining knowledge in areas such as networking, information security, web development, etc.. 
                    Aside from the curriculum, I am also a part of a couple extra-curriculars. As the Vice President of the Information Security Club, 
                    I am responsible for recruitment, seeking out knowledgeable speakers, and planning labs. I am also the BSIT Student Ambassador, 
                    this gives me the opportunity to meet with prospective students, visit and speak with community colleges about the program, 
                    and be a point of contact for incoming students. Within these two roles, I have gained skills such as leadership, time management, and responsibility.

            <h4>Associate of Arts, Liberal Arts, Associate of Science, General Science and Emphasis in Information Systems Technology - December 2017</h4>
                <p>
                    I was exposed to many different subject matters at JCCC, from Ethics to Object Oriented Programming. After completing two associate degrees, 
                    Liberal Arts and General Science, I decided to pursue something I had always had a knack for, 
                    Information Systems. It was in this degree path that I realized my passion for development and design. 
                    In 2017 I graduated with another associates in Information Systems Technology, which lead me to getting my Bachelors in Information Technology.

                <p>
                    In the time I have spent with Cerner I have worked on a few different things, including full-stack web development using JavaScript, 
                ReactJS, Node.js and Visual Basic for Applications to create macros. As an apprentice I am given hands on experience with many different aspects of automation and development.
                I look forward to continue learning within this company.

                <p>
                    Here I was able to develop tons of soft/people skills as these are essential when in any kind of customer service. 
                    I spent the first year and a half in one branch and the rest as a floater. As a floater I traveled to many different branches, 
                    this put me on the fast track to getting used to meeting new people all of the time. Every branch does things a little different, 
                    so adaptation was a huge part of the job.
