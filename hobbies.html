            <h2>Guitar</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been playing guitar and writing music for about 11 years. 
                    I try to play every day but realistically I play around 3-4 times a week. 
                    It is one of my favorite things to do and have been known to play for hours and lose track of time.

            <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of 2017 I began to get into mountain biking, for exercise and fun. Since then I have ridden many of the trails around Kansas City. 
                    In the spring of 2018 I traveled to Wilson, Kansas to ride one of the best trails in Kansas, Switchgrass Mountain Bike Trail (pictured). 
                    This trail system is about 30 miles in total and my brother and I did about 20 of those.

            <h2>My Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    Another thing that I love to do is hang out with my dogs, Blitz and Scout. 
                    Blitz is a 6 year old German Shepherd and Scout is a 2 year old Welsh Corgi. 
                    They are the most interesting little duo, because Scout has Blitz wrapped around her paw. Small but mighty (but mostly bossy).
